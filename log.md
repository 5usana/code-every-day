### Day 8: April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django REST Framework

**Thoughts** after all that Django setup, we undid the built in template language and replaced it with Django REST Framework package for JSON API usage. I still struggled with setting up the virtual envirnoment but it I noticed navigating through it a little more easily this time around.

### Day 7: April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django practice!

**Thoughts** created views, templates, & set up routing for complete CRUD functionality! SO MUCH bug hunting during class today, it went by so quickly I was just trying to keep up. For hw, I had to set up my URL's, views, and templates for Nostaldja fads & decades.  I was so close but I nested my files and ran into issues. my fad/new & decade/new paths finally worked but i broke the other paths. a bit frustrating.

### Day 6: April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done with this week's open source contributions, and a little python refresher.

**Thoughts** I really wanted to contribute something better, but I kept choosing repo's that were more difficult than I had expected. SO today I eventually went with an easy one and watched a Python tutorial since it's been harder to pick up than I expeced. Looking forward to getting back in class tomorrow to code alongside my cohort!

### Day 5: April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Knocked out a few more pull requests for my Hackweek assignment!

**Thoughts** Although some of my pulls do not pass the checks, I a appreciating the exposure. It's nerve racking opening someone elses repo and making changes/contributions, but it's getting slightly less scary. The community has been welcoming so far, it's inspiring.

### Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python is kicking my ass but I made a little progress in class today. 

**Thoughts** Today I made attempts to contribute on open source repos and i'd like to document a fail. My checks were not succesful and my merge was blocked. I spent a couple hours going over articles and material to ensure I could succesfully contribute, made requests but was unsucessful today. I'd like to remember that although some days dont bring wins, I still tried and I will continue to.
