### Day 80: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: study for HackerRank test

**Thoughts** I had an interview with HakcerRank yesterday and they sent me a test to take, if I pass then I will continue with the inteview process. so after a couple meetings with my Make it MVP team, I set those duties aside and have been studying and coding in preperation for my test. I'm nervous that i am not yet a strong enough coder but that wont' stop me from trying! I continued to practice today, I have 1 complete Kata, and another HakcerRank 30daysofcode challenge done. tomorrow i will take the test and find out if i can move forward with the interiew process. regardless of the outcome, if i continue then damn thats exciting, if i fail then i just have to work twice as hard and keep trying!

### Day 48: June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: GA June 3 day sprint Hackathon

**Thoughts**Day 3 was killer! Half of the team stayed up and saw the sunrise together. I feel honored to have worked with such a dedicated group of individuals. Today I covered more front end css, and familiarized myself more with style. One of my teammates couldnt physically code due to errors with node sass on his computer so we did some pair programming together, it was a wonderful learning experience for me. My skills are still building, and i loved absorbing his knowledge and seeing how he tackled vanilla javascript and translated it into sass.

### Day --: June 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**:  Women Who Code CONNECT REIMAGINE 2021 Conference

**Thoughts** Aftr memorial day weekend, I visit family in Utah. I spent time coding the first two days then fully submerged myself in enjoying quality time with my neice and nephews. I haven't been unemployed most of my adult life, so taking a whole week to hang out with family was a luxury I couldn't afford to lose. it was absolutely lovely. I had my first interview which I rocked, hopefully I'll move on to the next phase.
coming back today i was incredibly inspired by so many badass women speaking at Women Who Code CONNECT REIMAGINE 2021 Conference. I also connected with someone on LinkedIn who reached out to seak advice regarding my bootcamp experience. afterwards i truly felt like i saw a spark in her, i think i helped inspire her to push for it. exciting!!!
alright, i need to dive back in, i miss creating. coding to come!!

### Day 37: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: last day of GA livibl-may2021 HACKATHON

**Thoughts** It was a mad scramble tying up loose ends for our project. everything was deployed early but during the final hour our front end wouldnt deploy, luckly we got it working on time for presentations. I loved the structure of having a team to work with. The exposure to UX designers and data scientist was foriegn, I am beyond grateful for the experience, and would love to do these more often. My team got along so well, we decided we want to get back together next week to pick up where we left off to improve our app. check it out!

**Thoughts** I'm spending way too much time on styling, but I really enjoy it. I feel like I should have spent more time on coding today but that's ok. I heard a quote, "do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life". today was so fun it kind of felt like that.

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp & codewars

**Thoughts** I appreciate the dedication to using twitter for learning in public and holding myself accountable, but I have to say it's HARD see everyone's tweets because i keep comparing myself to others progress. yes, i am extremely proud and happy for my classmates, I know we are at different parts of our coding journey, but I can't help it. ok, I wont linger on that thought but I wanted to put it out there. I'm getting better each day and that's what matters.

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp & codewars

**Thoughts** nervouse that i'm lingering too long on freeCodeCamp but bootcamp went by so quick i feel the need to realy focus on javascript so that i at least have 1 language I am good at. I'd like to play aorund mroe with python, but maybe once I have a better understanding of javascript i'll give it another go.

### Day 23: May 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: started portfolio in react & attended 2 seperate behavioral interview webinars

**Thoughts**  i'm still playing with webflow to create my portfolio but part of me still wants to at least try building it from scratch so i started a react app. I may go either way, but for now it will keep me busy. This morning I had a behavioral webinar through GA and ended up signing up for a speed networking and interview practice. It was nice, I met some great people, expanded my network and brushed up on my interviewing skills.

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp practice

**Thoughts**  one thing i'd like to acknowledge is that when I first started practicing on freecodecamp is that i almost  always depended on the hint/help section but I noticed I'm using it less and less with each lesson. I'll take that win!

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp brush up, introduction to Webflow

**Thoughts**  Ok monday was the last day of my software engineering bootcamp so I enjoyed a few days with my laptop off to decompress. BACK AT it with #100daysofcode I'm honetly a bit overwlemed and uncertain of where to start. so today I hopped onto freecodecamp for a couple lessons, and checked out webflow to start working on my protfolio. I can't wait to have my first portfolio up and going!! Hoping to have it up within a week.

### Day 17: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 4 -finished modify/delete functionality -signin/sign up components created but no functionality. researched local storage 

**Thoughts**  I have a rough MVP, but my signin & sign up not functioning. I looked into using local storage since I don't have a backend. When will trying something new not be so damn intimidating? I get so nervous and build up unnecessary anxiety. definitely something to work on.

### Day 15: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: updated project components & played with storybook

**Thoughts** project week is HARD, the highs and lows can be debilitating at times. it feels like a type of paralysis, and i cant help but feel the rise in panic. So let's focus on the positive. My components are taking shape, i added state to the blog postings to see the title, content and previous postings which i found on a blog tutorial. my project is only the front end, but i want to build a backend as well to actually save the content. im panicking just thinking about it, this all feels so fresh i dont know how to tackle it without help. it's embarassing. oh man, these posts are getting a bit too real!
i couldn't get past a bug with storybook, but my instructor helped me setup another so i finally played with storybook. the add ons are cool, i saw an extension for figma that looks to make designing easier. looking forward to getting mroe practice with it.

**Today's Progress**: React & storybook

**Thoughts** for project week I'm making a blog with React and attempting to incorporate Storybook but I can't get past a bug. I'm trying one more time tomorrow but i'm afraid with my tight deadline that i'll need to find another new source of technology to tie into my last project with GA.
I'm already struggling to get the blog going, don't get me wrong i'm proud of how much I've accomplished in the last 11 weeks of this course but there is still so much more practice and studying I need to do. I want to make something i can be really proud of. today i set up my components and my routes! My progress is slow, but this isn't a race. My magic is slowly building.

**Thoughts** I started a storybook tutorial to get a  feel for it and see if I could incorporate it in with project 4. I spent hours debugging and error with babel-loader only to hit another issue immediately after. Had a quick standup with a couple cohort mates but no solution was found. Going to take another look at it this week or move onto something else.

**Thoughts** after all that Django setup, we undid the built in template language and replaced it with Django REST Framework package for JSON API usage. I still struggled with setting up the virtual envirnoment but it I noticed navigating through it a little more easily this time around.

**Today's Progress**: Django practice!

**Thoughts** created views, templates, & set up routing for complete CRUD functionality! SO MUCH bug hunting during class today, it went by so quickly I was just trying to keep up. For hw, I had to set up my URL's, views, and templates for Nostaldja fads & decades.  I was so close but I nested my files and ran into issues. my fad/new & decade/new paths finally worked but i broke the other paths. a bit frustrating.

### Day 6: April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done with this week's open source contributions, and a little python refresher.

**Thoughts** I really wanted to contribute something better, but I kept choosing repo's that were more difficult than I had expected. SO today I eventually went with an easy one and watched a Python tutorial since it's been harder to pick up than I expeced. Looking forward to getting back in class tomorrow to code alongside my cohort!

### Day 5: April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Knocked out a few more pull requests for my Hackweek assignment!

**Thoughts** Although some of my pulls do not pass the checks, I a appreciating the exposure. It's nerve racking opening someone elses repo and making changes/contributions, but it's getting slightly less scary. The community has been welcoming so far, it's inspiring.

### Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python is kicking my ass but I made a little progress in class today. 

**Thoughts** Today I made attempts to contribute on open source repos and i'd like to document a fail. My checks were not succesful and my merge was blocked. I spent a couple hours going over articles and material to ensure I could succesfully contribute, made requests but was unsucessful today. I'd like to remember that although some days dont bring wins, I still tried and I will continue to.
