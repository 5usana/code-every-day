# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done with this week's open source contributions

**Thoughts** I really wanted to contribute something better, but I kept choosing repo's that were more difficult than I had expected. SO today I eventually went with an easy one and watched a Python tutorial since it's been harder to pick up than I expeced. Looking forward to getting back in class tomorrow to code alongside my cohort!

### Day 4: April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Knocked out a few more pull requests for my Hackweek assignment!

**Thoughts** Although some of my pulls do not pass the checks, I a appreciating the exposure. It's nerve racking opening someone elses repo and making changes/contributions, but it's getting slightly less scary. The community has been welcoming so far, it's inspiring.

### Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python is kicking my ass but I made a little progress in class today. 

**Thoughts** Today I made attempts to contribute on open source repos and i'd like to document a fail. My checks were not succesful and my merge was blocked. I spent a couple hours going over articles and material to ensure I could succesfully contribute, made requests but was unsucessful today. I'd like to remember that although some days dont bring wins, I still tried and I will continue to.
