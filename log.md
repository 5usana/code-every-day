**Today's Progress**: Committing to the #100DaysOfCode challenge. SO EXCITED!!

**Thoughts**: This is what I need to add structure to my journey, starting this bootcamp with 0 experience has been a really hard but exciting challenege. 100 Days of coding will keep my mind busy and add structure to life post school!

### Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python is kicking my ass but I made a little progress in class today. 

**Thoughts** Today I made attempts to contribute on open source repos and i'd like to document a fail. My checks were not succesful and my merge was blocked. I spent a couple hours going over articles and material to ensure I could succesfully contribute, made requests but was unsucessful today. I'd like to remember that although some days dont bring wins, I still tried and I will continue to.
