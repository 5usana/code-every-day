### Day 30: May 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: portfolio styling

**Thoughts** I'm spending way too much time on styling, but I really enjoy it. I feel like I should have spent more time on coding today but that's ok. I heard a quote, "do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life". today was so fun it kind of felt like that.

### Day 29: May 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp & codewars

**Thoughts** I appreciate the dedication to using twitter for learning in public and holding myself accountable, but I have to say it's HARD see everyone's tweets because i keep comparing myself to others progress. yes, i am extremely proud and happy for my classmates, I know we are at different parts of our coding journey, but I can't help it. ok, I wont linger on that thought but I wanted to put it out there. I'm getting better each day and that's what matters.

### Day 28: May 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp & codewars

**Thoughts** nervouse that i'm lingering too long on freeCodeCamp but bootcamp went by so quick i feel the need to realy focus on javascript so that i at least have 1 language I am good at. I'd like to play aorund mroe with python, but maybe once I have a better understanding of javascript i'll give it another go.

### Day 23: May 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: started portfolio in react & attended 2 seperate behavioral interview webinars

**Thoughts**  i'm still playing with webflow to create my portfolio but part of me still wants to at least try building it from scratch so i started a react app. I may go either way, but for now it will keep me busy. This morning I had a behavioral webinar through GA and ended up signing up for a speed networking and interview practice. It was nice, I met some great people, expanded my network and brushed up on my interviewing skills.

### Day 22: May 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Outcomes w/GA, Codewars, resume/coverletter brush up, signed up for Hired

**Thoughts**  finding my footing post GA Bootcamp has been hard. I picked out an easy codewar challenge to attempt today. added a cover letter to my artillery and carved out a schedule for myself. a minimum of 25hrs a week dedicated to coding, applying to jobs, networking and projects. here we go.

### Day 21: May 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp practice

**Thoughts**  one thing i'd like to acknowledge is that when I first started practicing on freecodecamp is that i almost  always depended on the hint/help section but I noticed I'm using it less and less with each lesson. I'll take that win!

### Day 20: April 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp brush up, introduction to Webflow

**Thoughts**  Ok monday was the last day of my software engineering bootcamp so I enjoyed a few days with my laptop off to decompress. BACK AT it with #100daysofcode I'm honetly a bit overwlemed and uncertain of where to start. so today I hopped onto freecodecamp for a couple lessons, and checked out webflow to start working on my protfolio. I can't wait to have my first portfolio up and going!! Hoping to have it up within a week.

### Day 18/19: April 23/24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 4 finalized!!

**Thoughts**  Finalized project 4 with styling, attempted building out the backend with  Express but it was never connected. I'll be looking into this and coming back to update my project.

### Day 17: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 4 -finished modify/delete functionality -signin/sign up components created but no functionality. researched local storage 

**Thoughts**  I have a rough MVP, but my signin & sign up not functioning. I looked into using local storage since I don't have a backend. When will trying something new not be so damn intimidating? I get so nervous and build up unnecessary anxiety. definitely something to work on.

### Day 16: April 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: added storybook into my project, had to pump the breaks for now. researched/attempted burger menu, might circle back. not a priority & started modify/delete buttons

**Thoughts** am i over complicating things with storybook? it should be simple. try try and try again, it'll happen.

### Day 15: April 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: updated project components & played with storybook

**Thoughts** project week is HARD, the highs and lows can be debilitating at times. it feels like a type of paralysis, and i cant help but feel the rise in panic. So let's focus on the positive. My components are taking shape, i added state to the blog postings to see the title, content and previous postings which i found on a blog tutorial. my project is only the front end, but i want to build a backend as well to actually save the content. im panicking just thinking about it, this all feels so fresh i dont know how to tackle it without help. it's embarassing. oh man, these posts are getting a bit too real!
i couldn't get past a bug with storybook, but my instructor helped me setup another so i finally played with storybook. the add ons are cool, i saw an extension for figma that looks to make designing easier. looking forward to getting mroe practice with it.

### Day 14: April 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: React & storybook

**Thoughts** for project week I'm making a blog with React and attempting to incorporate Storybook but I can't get past a bug. I'm trying one more time tomorrow but i'm afraid with my tight deadline that i'll need to find another new source of technology to tie into my last project with GA.
I'm already struggling to get the blog going, don't get me wrong i'm proud of how much I've accomplished in the last 11 weeks of this course but there is still so much more practice and studying I need to do. I want to make something i can be really proud of. today i set up my components and my routes! My progress is slow, but this isn't a race. My magic is slowly building.

### Day 13: April 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Blog React tutorial

**Thoughts** looking for inspiration i started this blog tutorial. It's wild looking back on my first project and going into my 4th project, I have a long way to go but I've picked up on so much. React is making more sense, I can't wait to see what I can do!

### Day 12: April 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Storybook for React tutorial

**Thoughts** I started a storybook tutorial to get a  feel for it and see if I could incorporate it in with project 4. I spent hours debugging and error with babel-loader only to hit another issue immediately after. Had a quick standup with a couple cohort mates but no solution was found. Going to take another look at it this week or move onto something else.

### Day 11: April 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Mock interview practice

**Thoughts** It was nerve racking watching a fellow cohort mate be interviewed but it was eye opening. I practiced the interview process myself and went through essential javascript interview questions.

### Day 8: April 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django REST Framework

**Thoughts** after all that Django setup, we undid the built in template language and replaced it with Django REST Framework package for JSON API usage. I still struggled with setting up the virtual envirnoment but it I noticed navigating through it a little more easily this time around.

### Day 7: April 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Django practice!

**Thoughts** created views, templates, & set up routing for complete CRUD functionality! SO MUCH bug hunting during class today, it went by so quickly I was just trying to keep up. For hw, I had to set up my URL's, views, and templates for Nostaldja fads & decades.  I was so close but I nested my files and ran into issues. my fad/new & decade/new paths finally worked but i broke the other paths. a bit frustrating.

### Day 6: April 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Done with this week's open source contributions, and a little python refresher.

**Thoughts** I really wanted to contribute something better, but I kept choosing repo's that were more difficult than I had expected. SO today I eventually went with an easy one and watched a Python tutorial since it's been harder to pick up than I expeced. Looking forward to getting back in class tomorrow to code alongside my cohort!

### Day 5: April 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Knocked out a few more pull requests for my Hackweek assignment!

**Thoughts** Although some of my pulls do not pass the checks, I a appreciating the exposure. It's nerve racking opening someone elses repo and making changes/contributions, but it's getting slightly less scary. The community has been welcoming so far, it's inspiring.

### Day 3: April 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Python is kicking my ass but I made a little progress in class today. 

**Thoughts** Today I made attempts to contribute on open source repos and i'd like to document a fail. My checks were not succesful and my merge was blocked. I spent a couple hours going over articles and material to ensure I could succesfully contribute, made requests but was unsucessful today. I'd like to remember that although some days dont bring wins, I still tried and I will continue to.
